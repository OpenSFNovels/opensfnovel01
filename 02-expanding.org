* Expand the Single Sentence into a full paragraph of 5 sentences

Describe the story setup, three act structure and an ending. Think of this like
three disasters and an ending. Ideally, with the second and third disasters
caused by the protagonistâ€™s attempts to fix things.


Let's each try to do two or three 5-sentence paragraphs to play with the idea
and we can see where we overlap or not.

The sentence that we're working with is:

= A hacker must save the world after a practical joke inadvertently starts a
robot uprising.=

** Paragraphs
