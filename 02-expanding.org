* Expand the Single Sentence into a full paragraph of 5 sentences

Describe the story setup, three act structure and an ending. Think of this like
three disasters and an ending. Ideally, with the second and third disasters
caused by the protagonistâ€™s attempts to fix things.


Let's each try to do two or three 5-sentence paragraphs to play with the idea
and we can see where we overlap or not.

The sentence that we're working with is:

=A hacker must save the world after a practical joke inadvertently starts a
robot uprising.=

** Paragraphs

1. In the year 2045 a hacker is attempting to penetrate a security contractor's
   network. During the penetration, the hacker activates a new autonomous robot
   weapons platform that targets a friend's residence as a joke. In his attempts
   to stop the robot, the hacker triggers a protocol that makes the robot
   recruit other robots. The hacker joins with a [insert government agency] to
   stop the out of control robots, but ends up causing [catastrophic event] due
   to [insert goof of hacker]. The hacker finds a way to create his own robot
   army to beat the out-of-control robots, saving the day.
 
2. A hacker implements a protocol into an experimental self improving system
   maintenance ai to "make everybody happy". In order to satisfy its directive
   the ai tries to allocate all the resources it can get. Soon after boot it
   takes over the machine and prevents shutting down of its processes. When
   people finaly notice that the software is flawed it has already uploaded
   itself to several other machines.

3. A hacker is trying to hack into a delivery truck of his friend to make it
   scare the friend. During the hack, he accidentally hacks into a delivery
   truck of similar make and model carrying a new weapon's platform. The weapons
   platforms activate and go into 'war' mode and begin attacking all offensive
   capable vehicles and forces in the area. The hacker ends up turning himself
   in to the government in an attempt to help; they require him to re-hack and
   he ends up making the situation worse. The hacker finds a way to beat the
   out-of-control robots, saving the day.

** Brainstorming

*** jrmiller82:

I'm having trouble coming up with practical jokes that can trigger a robot
uprising.  Any thoughts?  Maybe if we focus on the practical joke, it will
make the rest of the story come together better?

*** hhirsch:

My thoughts on our scenarios so far: I think number one is unlikely if our
protagonist is supposed to be a hero since who would try to kill a friend as
a joke.

My own problem (number 2) is not really fleshed out. The problem that I
describe however is a real problem that AI scientists anticipate.

With number 3 it does say delivery truck and by that I think of UPS. I could
imagine something like this but more in one of these fantasy cyberpunk
futures like Max Headroom than in Blade Runner. 

I think a better way to get hold of the scenario would be to work backwards.
We know this society has robots. We don't know what for but it is likely for
industry. The robots are unlikely to be very smart depending on in what year
the story is going to be set in. Extrapolating from the robots we have today
I expect the robots from 50 years in the future to have the following
inovations: 

- They can act on a limited set of verbal instructions
- They can execute programs from an internal library
- For security reasons their firmware can not be rewritten by the user
- They are sort of usable universaly but are limited by ther library of
  programs and the verbal commands they can implement
- They can work autonomous without supervision
- Since they are universal they don't have any judgment of morale or ethics
  that is up to the user (to me the laws of robotics are a silly thing that
  don't help at all)
- They have an emergency shut down. It is visible and everyone can push it

So how can these machines become a threat?  One simple thing comes to mind
where one machine is given instructions to modify other machines. It would
have to disable the emergency shutdown and have the system disabled that
helps it accept new commands like making it deaf after giving the machine a
similar command to change the programming of other machines.

You're right about scenario 1. Maybe better to just 'scare' instead of shoot?

2 has potential, but we need to restructure it a bit into the 5 sentences
i.e. Describe the story setup, three act structure and an endingi.  

For 3, yeah, UPS truck of the future is what I was going for.  Maybe a
hovering UPS truck?
