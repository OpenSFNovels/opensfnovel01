* Snowflake Stage 01 -- Story Lines
This is the file where we'll pick our storylines for the very first
part of the snowflake.

Ideally, I'd like to see /at least/ 10 or 20 story lines before we get
into voting. Ideally we'd have a lot more. And only contributors with
accepted pull requests get to vote come the voting stage. Contributors
with many accepted pull requests may be given revocable collaborator
status in Github so they can work on the repository directly, assuming
they don't abuse their privilege.
